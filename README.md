# Email_Spam_Detection
A ML Project for detecting the span in the e-mails.

# ðŸ“§ Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is a **Machine Learning-based Email Spam Classifier** that detects whether an email is **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)**. The model is trained using **Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques** and **classification algorithms**.

## Â Features

- Preprocessing of email text (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)**
- Classification using **NaÃ¯ve Bayes / Logistic Regression / Random Forest** (mention what you used)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Â Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Scikit-Learn**
- **Pandas & NumPy**
- **NLTK**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**

## Â Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing contains labeled emails as **Spam or Ham**. It has been preprocessed to remove noise and irrelevant information.

## Â How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ARYAKRI/Email_Spam_Detection.git
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the notebook or script to train the model.

## Results

The trained model achieved **XX% accuracy** (replace with actual performance metrics).

## Â Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of **NLP and ML techniques** to classify emails effectively. Future improvements could include **deep learning models** like LSTMs for better accuracy.
